name="Rust Auto Compile"
description="Rust Auto Compile is a simple script that runs cargo automatically before you run your game.

It adds 2 settings:
rust/cargo_path: The path to your cargo executable
rust/cargo_manifest: The path to the Cargo.toml of the library you want built.

You need to have those 2 settings set for the plugin to work."
